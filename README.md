Tic-Tac-Toe with Graphical Interface
This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game with a graphical user interface, built using Python and `tkinter`. It offers a simple, intuitive interface for two players who take turns selecting boxes on a 3x3 grid. The game recognizes the winner, detects a draw, and provides an option to restart.

## Features

- **Player Switching**: The game automatically switches between Player X and Player O.
- **Winner Detection**: As soon as a player completes a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line, they are announced as the winner.
- **Draw Detection**: Recognizes a draw when the entire grid is filled and no player has won.
- **Restart Option**: A restart button is available to start a new game round without restarting the program.
- **Winner Display**: Displays the winning player after each round.
